# Screenshot Translation Tool: Developer Specification

## Overview
This application is designed to allow users to capture a portion of their screen, automatically detect the text within the screenshot, and overlay the translated text in the user's selected language. The tool will be compatible with Windows 10 and 11.

## Key Features
- **Screenshot Capture:** The user can press a keyboard shortcut to capture any region of the screen.
- **Text Recognition and Translation:** The tool will perform OCR on the captured screenshot, detect the language, and translate the text to the user’s selected language.
- **Overlay Translated Text:** The translated text will be overlaid directly on the screenshot.
- **Minimal Interaction:** Users can either:
  - Copy all translated text to the clipboard.
  - Copy the image with the overlayed translated text to the clipboard.

## Requirements

### 1. **System Requirements**
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 and 11.
- **Dependencies:** 
  - **OCR and Translation APIs** (e.g., OpenAI or Anthropic models).
  - **Microsoft .NET Core** for server-side REST APIs.
  - **UI Framework:** Modern, popular, free-to-use Windows UI framework.

### 2. **User Registration and API Key**
- **Registration Fields (Required):**
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Mobile Number
  - Email Address
  - Password
- **Optional Information:**
  - Full Address
  - Company Name
- **API Key Generation:** 
  - Once registration is complete, the API key is generated.
  - The API key will be stored securely in **Windows Credential Manager**.

### 3. **Core Functionalities**

#### 3.1 **Keyboard Shortcut and Screenshot Capture**
- Upon pressing a designated keyboard shortcut, the application:
  - Dims the screen to indicate activation.
  - Changes the cursor to a crosshair for user selection.
  - Allows the user to click and drag to select the area to capture.
  - Once the area is selected, the user releases the mouse, and the screenshot is processed.
  
#### 3.2 **Text Recognition (OCR)**
- **OCR:** The application will use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from the selected screenshot area.

#### 3.3 **Text Translation**
- The extracted text will be sent to a translation API for processing.
- Default translation language will be set to the Windows language version at the time of installation, but the user can change the output language via system tray preferences.

#### 3.4 **Text Overlay**
- The translated text will be overlaid directly on the original screenshot.
- If the translated text is shorter or longer than the original, the font size will be adjusted automatically. If alignment is still an issue, the text will be resized or squeezed to fit without overlapping. The focus is on human readability.

### 4. **Error Handling**
- **Failure Scenarios:** 
  - Text detection failure: “Text unrecognizable.”
  - No internet connection: “Online services unreachable.”
  - Text too small to detect: “Text is too small.”
- A failure message will appear within the screenshot area. The user will need to click outside the screenshot to close the message and can attempt the translation again by pressing the keyboard shortcut.

### 5. **User Interface**

#### 5.1 **System Tray and Preferences**
- A system tray icon will allow the user to:
  - Open a dialog box for application preferences.
  - Select the output translation language.
  - Choose the AI translation model (default at install, with the ability to select between approved models from OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

#### 5.2 **Interaction Options**
- Upon processing:
  - **Option 1:** Copy all translated text to the clipboard.
  - **Option 2:** Copy the image with the overlayed translated text to the clipboard.

### 6. **Authentication**
- The application will require an API key, generated during the registration process.
- Users will need to reinstall the application if they wish to regenerate their API key.

### 7. **Cloud Integration**
- **Server-Side API:** Written in **.NET C#**, hosted in **Azure**.
- API will handle OCR and translation requests.
- API Key authentication will be required for every request.
- The application will communicate with the server-side API to process screenshots and translations.

### 8. **Data Handling**
- **Data Storage:** 
  - The user’s API key will be stored securely in the **Windows Credential Manager**.
  - All user preferences (language, model selection) will be stored in a local configuration file.
  
### 9. **Update Handling**
- The application will not automatically update in the first version.
- The user must manually download and install new versions from the website.
  
### 10. **Installation Process**
- **Installer Type:** A structured `.exe` installer (not `.msi`).
  - During installation, the user will be required to complete registration.
  - After successful registration, the API key will be generated and stored securely in **Windows Credential Manager**.
  - The installer will include a brief guide on how to use the application, including the keyboard shortcut and how to manage preferences.

### 11. **API Specifications**

#### 11.1 **API Key Authentication**
- **Endpoint:** `/authenticate`
  - Method: `POST`
  - Body: `{ "apiKey": "string" }`
  - Response: `{ "status": "success" | "error", "message": "string" }`

#### 11.2 **OCR and Translation**
- **Endpoint:** `/process-screenshot`
  - Method: `POST`
  - Body: `{ "image": "base64EncodedImage", "outputLanguage": "string" }`
  - Response: 
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "translatedText": "string",
      "imageWithOverlay": "base64EncodedImage"
    }
    ```

## Testing Plan

### 1. **Unit Tests**
- **OCR Functionality:** Test text extraction from various screenshot sizes and text complexities.
- **Translation:** Test translation accuracy for different languages.
- **Overlay:** Ensure the translated text is properly overlayed, and check font size adjustment when text is too long or short.

### 2. **Integration Tests**
- Test the interaction between OCR, translation, and overlay.
- Ensure the application successfully communicates with the server-side API.

### 3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
- Test the registration process and API key generation.
- Test the system tray functionality and language/model preferences.
- Test error handling (no internet, unrecognizable text, etc.).

## Development Blueprint

Below is a step-by-step plan to build this project:

1. Project Setup  
   - Initialize a .NET Core solution.  
   - Set up basic solution structure with folders for UI, server, and shared models.  

2. Registration and API Key Generation  
   - Create a user registration form in the UI.  
   - Implement server-side endpoints to store user details and generate an API key.  
   - Store the API key securely in Windows Credential Manager.  

3. Screenshot Capture and Keyboard Shortcut  
   - Establish a global keyboard hook to detect the screenshot shortcut.  
   - Implement click-and-drag region selection.  
   - Capture and encode the screenshot to be sent to the server API.  

4. OCR and Translation  
   - Implement OCR workflow in the server API.  
   - Integrate translation APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).  
   - Return translated text and the image with overlays.  

5. Overlay Mechanism  
   - Receive overlayed image from server or generate overlay locally.  
   - Auto-adjust font size or spacing to accommodate text.  
   - Provide options to copy text or the new image to clipboard.  

6. System Tray and Preferences  
   - Implement a system tray icon for user preferences.  
   - Allow language selection, AI model selection, and other settings.  

7. Error Handling and Logging  
   - Capture no-internet or OCR-failure scenarios.  
   - Log errors locally for troubleshooting.  

8. Deployment and Installer  
   - Package the solution in a structured .exe installer.  
   - Integrate registration into the installation process.  
   - Provide usage instructions and keyboard shortcut details.
